# DiscreteGeneralizedSensitivities

This is an implementation of the numerical methods developed in:
- [*Discrete Tangent and Adjoint Sensitivity Analysis for Discontinuous Solutions of Hyperbolic Conservation Laws*](https://doi.org/10.18154/RWTH-2022-06229) 
- [*Algorithmic Differentiation of Hyperbolic Flow Problems*](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcp.2021.110110)

The available implementation demonstrates the techniques on the solution to Burgers Equation with a particular initial condition, where the exact solution is known.
